# Hackers: The RPG
Hackers is a game, predictably, about hacking. Although it will eventually be possible to play both with or without a computer, the initial version will be focused on the computer until the rules are finalised.

## Installation
You can compile the existing code by running the following commands from within the source directory:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./hackers_rpg
```
